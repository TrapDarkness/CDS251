program CramersRule

   ! System of equations. 2x2, 3x3
   ! The main program is written for you. Read through the comments and
   ! see how the main program works.
   ! 2 Special Notes!!!!!
   ! 1: Take note of how the logial variable 'Success' will either write
   !    the solution or 'No Solution' to the output file.
   ! 2: Take note of how inside the do loop, allocating and deallocating
   !    memory for the arrays Matrix1, b, and x are done so the amount of
   !    memory allocated changes for each system. You cannot allocate more
   !    memory for an array until currently allocated memory is deallocated.
   
   implicit none
   
   ! Declare varialble
   integer :: n, row, col, i
   real, allocatable :: Matrix1(:,:), b(:), x(:)
   real :: detA, detM, determinant
   logical :: Success
   
   ! Open the input and output files.
   open(42,file='Data2.txt')
   open(43,file='Data2Out.txt')
   
   ! Solve each system in the input files.
   do
      ! Read in size of first system.
      read(42,*) n
      if (n .eq. 0) exit  ! Quit if zero.
      
      ! Allocate memory for system, right hand side, and solution vector.
      allocate(Matrix1(n,n), b(n), x(n))
      
      ! Read in the system. Ask if you do not understand how this works!
      do row = 1, n
         read(42,*) (Matrix1(row, col), col = 1, n), b(row)
      enddo
      
      ! Use cramers rule to get solution.
      call Cramer(Matrix1, b, n, x, Success)
      
      if (Success) then
         ! Write solution to file
         do row = 1, n
            write(43,*) x(row)
         enddo
         write(43,*)
      else ! This happens when there is no unique solution.
         write(43,*) 'No Solution'
         write(43,*)
      endif
      
      ! clean up memory and go back up to top for next system.
      deallocate(Matrix1, b, x)
      
   enddo
   
   ! close files
   close(42)

subroutine Cramer(M, b, n, x, Success)

   ! This subroutine does Cramer's Rule
   
   
   ! Declare and initialize your variables first.

      
   ! Find the determinant of M first. print it to screen.
   ! If it is zero, set the Success logical variable and quit.

      
   ! Allocate memory for a working matrix for column substituion. Then, for each
   ! column, i, substitute column i with vector b and get that determinant. 
   ! Compute the ith solution.

      
   ! deallocate memory for the working matrix.
   
      
end subroutine Cramer

subroutine ColumnInsert(M, b, n, col, MatOut)

   ! This subroutine takes vector b and inserts in into matrix M at column col.
   ! Don't forget to set MatOut = M before you substitute the column in.
      

end subroutine ColumnInsert

function Determinant(M, n) result(Det)

   ! This function computes the determinant of matices of size 2 or 3. This
   ! should just be an if...else....endif. One is the formula for a 2x2
   ! and the other is the formula for the 3x3 determinant.
